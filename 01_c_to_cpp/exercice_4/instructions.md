## Exercice

- Change the macro `MY_VARIABLE` to use constexpr int instead
- Create a square constexpr function
- Affect the constexpr variable to a call of square function

## Bonus

- Use static_assert to verify the result of your square function and try to compile
- Try to set a wrong assertion and try to compile, what do you observe ?

If you've done all these steps, congratulations you just created compile-time unit tests ;)
